# Discrete Wavelet Transform

Take images

<li>
10 iris images
</li>
<li>10 finger print images
</li>
<li>10 finger vein images
</li>

<li>Calculate the Discrete Wavelet transform of these images. You will get 4 outputs. 
</li>
<li>
  Determine the frequency components of these 4 outputs of each image.
</li>

Put next to each other:
the original image of an iris
its fourier transform
the 1st output (of discrete wavelet transform) 
the fourier transform of 3
the 2nd output (of discrete wavelet transform) 
the fourier transform of 6
the 3rd output (of discrete wavelet transform) 
the fourier transform of 8
the 4th output (of discrete wavelet transform) 
the fourier transform of 12
